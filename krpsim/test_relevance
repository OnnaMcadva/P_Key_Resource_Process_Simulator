# Test file to demonstrate relevant process filtering
# We have two independent production chains:
# Chain A: euro -> equipment -> product -> happy_client (TARGET)
# Chain B: gold -> jewelry -> luxury_item (NOT TARGET - should be ignored!)
#

# Initial stocks
euro:20
gold:10

# Chain A - leads to optimization target
equipment_purchase:(euro:8):(equipment:1):5
product_creation:(equipment:1):(product:1):10
delivery:(product:1):(happy_client:1):5

# Chain B - does NOT lead to optimization target (waste of resources!)
jewelry_making:(gold:5):(jewelry:1):8
luxury_packaging:(jewelry:1):(luxury_item:1):3

# Only optimize happy_client (NOT luxury_item!)
optimize:(happy_client)
